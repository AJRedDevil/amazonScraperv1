## Usage

#### What can you use an Amazon Scraper for ?

1. **Scrape Product Details that you can’t get with the Product Advertising API**

   Amazon provides a Product Advertising API, but like most other “API”s, this API doesn’t provide all the information that Amazon has on a product page.A scraper can help you extract all the details displayed on the product page.

2. **Monitor products for change in Price, Stock Count/Availability, Rating, etc.**

   By using a web scraper, you can update your data feeds on a timely basis to monitor any product changes. These data feeds can help you form pricing strategies by looking your competition – other sellers or brands.

3. **Analyze how a particular Brand sells on Amazon**

   If you’re a retailer, you can monitor your competitor’s products and see how well they do in the market and make adjustments to reprice and sell your products. You could also use it to _monitor your distribution channel_ to identify how your products are sold on Amazon by sellers, and if it is causing you any harm.

4. **Find Customer Opinions from Amazon Product Reviews**

   Reviews offer abundant amounts of information. If you’re targeting an established set of sellers who have been selling reasonable volumes, you can extract the reviews of their products to find what you should avoid and what you could quickly improve on while trying to sell similar products on Amazon.

Or anything else – the possibilities are endless and only bound by your imagination
